# Pnuemonia-Prediction
# Pneumonia Detection with Machine Learning

# Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assist in the diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening condition, and accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Leveraging machine learning techniques can aid healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled with binary classes: 'Normal' and 'Pneumonia'. It contains images obtained from pediatric patients, including both bacterial and viral pneumonia cases, as well as normal cases. The dataset is sourced from publicly available repositories or clinical datasets.

# Model Architecture:
The model architecture employed in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn features from the input data. The CNN architecture used here comprises several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

# Implementation:
The implementation of this project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The chest X-ray images are preprocessed to enhance their quality and prepare them for input into the model. Preprocessing steps may include resizing, normalization, and augmentation to increase the robustness of the model.

Model Training: The preprocessed images are fed into the CNN model for training. During training, the model learns to classify images into 'Normal' or 'Pneumonia' classes by adjusting its parameters to minimize a defined loss function.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate validation dataset to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data and provides reliable predictions.

Deployment: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in a real-world healthcare setting. This may involve integrating the model into existing medical systems or developing a standalone application for pneumonia diagnosis.

Usage:
To use the trained model for pneumonia detection:

Obtain a chest X-ray image.
Preprocess the image (resize, normalize) if necessary.
Feed the preprocessed image into the trained model.
Retrieve the model's prediction ('Normal' or 'Pneumonia').
Consult with a healthcare professional for further diagnosis and treatment.
# Requirements:
Python
PyTorch (for building and training the model)
Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)
OpenCV or PIL (for image preprocessing)
Any additional libraries as required
